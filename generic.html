									<h2>Hi, I'm Toby</h2> 
									I am a recent graduate from the University of Oklahoma with a 
									B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. 
									During my time in school, I had the opportunity to study various fields 
									of technology and mathematics. Two of which really sparked my interests, 
									data analysis and embedded software engineering.
								</p>
								<p>
									My interest in data analytics stemmed from courses in applied statistical methods
									and database mananagement systems. Here I developed skills in analysis and 
									visualization of data with R, and how to create and interact with relational databases 
									using SQL. This also motivated me to obtain the Google Data Analytics Professional
									Certificate where I gained practical experience in tools and platforms including 
									spreadsheets, SQL, Tableu, and R through case studies that represented real-world 
									business tasks and problems. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Similarily, I have also delved into the area of embedded software engineering, stemmed
									from a long standing interest in the aerospace industry. This has driven me to explore 
									the intricate realm of programming, particularly with complex systems. From there, I took 
									it upon my self to improve my skills in C++ and object-oriented programming by completing 
									a specialization certificate in C++ from Coursera, specifically geared towards object orientation.
									With my refined knwledge in C++, I also learned how to build microcontroller-based 
									systems so I can better understand how code drives and interacts with certain hardware and inputs. 
									Showcased with personal projects I built with an Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller,
									such as an Object Detection System using C++. 
								</p>
								<p>
									While these interests may seem disparate, I see opportunity for convergence of the two. What 
									excites me is the immense potential in leveraging data generated by embedded systems to improve 
									performance, enhance user experience, and drive innovation. As I embark on the next chapter of my journey, I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute 
									to organizations that share a passion for harnessing data-driven insights and pioneering embedded 
									solutions.
								</p>
								<p>
									I invite you to explore my portfolio and the projects I have been working on that showcase 
									my dedication and willingness to learn the skills to achieve my endeavors.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thank you for taking the time to visit my website!
